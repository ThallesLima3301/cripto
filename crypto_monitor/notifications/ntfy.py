"""HTTP sender for ntfy.sh notifications.

This module does one thing: given an `NtfySettings` and a title/body,
POST the message to the configured ntfy server and return a
`SendResult`. It has no knowledge of the database, the alert policy,
or quiet hours — those concerns live in `service.py` and `policy.py`.

Design notes
------------
* `NTFY_TOPIC` is validated at send time, not at config-load time.
  The user may run `cli init` before they've picked a topic; we want
  that to be a visible "missing topic" result at the first attempted
  send rather than a hard config-load crash.

* The HTTP layer is injected via an `http_post` callable so the tests
  do not import `requests`. Default behavior is to lazy-import
  `requests.post` on first use, which keeps `requests` out of the
  import graph for pure-policy tests.

* Retries use an injected `sleeper` callable (defaults to
  `time.sleep`). Tests pass a no-op. Retries are limited to network
  errors and 5xx responses — 4xx responses are a permanent error and
  we return immediately so we don't spam ntfy with a request it has
  already rejected.

* Backoff is **exponential**: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s between successive
  retries. `max_retries` in config caps the number of *additional*
  attempts after the first one, so `max_retries=2` means up to 3
  POSTs total (initial + 2 retries with 1s and 2s waits between).
